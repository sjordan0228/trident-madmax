# Ideas for Writing Updates on Filament Usage to an OpenPrintTag

This document outlines the logic and implementation details for updating filament usage data on an NFC tag using the OpenPrintTag standard.

## The Write Logic
The following function is designed to be triggered **60 seconds** after a filament unload is detected. This delay ensures that the final usage data is correctly recorded in Spoolman before being written back to the physical tag.

```python
def write_usage_to_tag(lane_id, spool_id):
    """Fetch current usage from Spoolman and write to NFC tag."""
    try:
        # 1. Get the latest 'consumed_weight' from Spoolman
        resp = requests.get(f"{SPOOLMAN_URL}/api/v1/spool/{spool_id}")
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            spool = resp.json()
            usage = spool.get("consumed_weight", 0)
            
            # 2. Determine which reader handles this lane
            reader_id = "reader1" if lane_id in [1, 2] else "reader2"
            
            # 3. Construct the OpenPrintTag payload
            # Key 0 is standard for 'consumed_weight' in many OpenPrintTag implementations
            payload = {0: round(usage, 2)}
            hex_data = encode_openprinttag(payload)
            
            if hex_data:
                # 4. Publish to the ESPHome write topic
                topic = f"nfc/{reader_id}/write"
                client.publish(topic, hex_data)
                logging.info(f"Wrote {usage}g to tag on Lane {lane_id} via {reader_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to write usage to tag: {e}")
```

## CBOR Encoding
OpenPrintTag uses the **CBOR** (Concise Binary Object Representation) format for data storage. We use the `cbor2` library to convert a Python dictionary into the compact binary format required by the tag.

```python
def encode_openprinttag(data_dict):
    """Encode dictionary to CBOR hex string."""
    try:
        # Convert dict to CBOR binary, then to hex string for MQTT transit
        encoded = cbor2.dumps(data_dict)
        return encoded.hex()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"CBOR Error: {e}")
        return None
```

## ESP32 Firmware (ESPHome)
On the ESP32 side, the reader listens for the `nfc/readerX/write` topic and executes a C++ lambda to perform the physical write to the tag's NDEF area.

```yaml
on_message:
  - topic: nfc/reader1/write
    then:
      - lambda: |-
          // Converts the hex string back to bytes and writes to the tag's NDEF area
          std::vector<uint8_t> data = hex_to_bytes(x);
          id(reader1).write_ndef(data);
```

## 👻 Possible Problems I Foresee
Using a single **PN5180** to read two lanes introduces a significant risk: there will almost certainly be times when the system tries to write an update, but the scanner picks up the **wrong NFC tag** because both are in the field.

While it might be tempting to just use a manual macro with a 3rd dedicated "update station" PN5180, we can implement a **Targeted Write** to solve this programmatically.

### Targeted Write Solution

#### Python Side
When the 1-minute timer expires, the script looks up the `target_uid` that was originally assigned to the lane. It sends a JSON message containing both that **UID** and the **NDEF data**.

#### ESP32 Side
The ESP32 firmware parses the JSON and checks if the `target_uid` is actually present in the reader's field.
*   **Match Found:** It performs the write.
*   **No Match:** (e.g., the tag was swapped during the 60-second window) It aborts the write and logs a warning to prevent data corruption.
